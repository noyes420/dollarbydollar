                <p class="text-lg text-blue-600">
                    Founded in 2024, Dollar by Dollar was born out of a desire to make financial literacy accessible to middle school students, empowering them with the knowledge and skills they need to navigate the world of money. We recognized that financial education often starts too late, leaving many young people unprepared for the financial decisions they'll face in adulthood.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-blue-600 mt-4">
                    Our mission is to change that by offering engaging, easy-to-understand resources and lessons that bring financial concepts to life for younger audiences. Through interactive workshops, online content, and community events, we aim to equip the next generation with the tools to build a secure financial future, one dollar at a time.
